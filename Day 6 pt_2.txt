well i finished learning bracket notions...
they were a lot more trouble than they were worth
makes me wonder if some of these lessons are worth it...
Then again they are making me think logically in a way you would
on a day to day basis with a real front end development job right?
At least i would like to think so! overall I am very happy with today's
progress and am looking forward to learning even more soon!
next lesson is on Basic "JavaScript: Word Blanks" wish me luck!
