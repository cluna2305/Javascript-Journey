wow ok so i learned today that with ctrl+shift+J i can open a javascript console in chrome! NEAT!
I also spent about 30 minutes today learning javascript goodies in general. it's such a tiny step but 
I hope this pays off one day :)
//random code that won't work on notepad i'm betting haha
1.console.log('Hiya, hope one day i can do great things!);
2.console.log('I guess today i learned you can do math stuff here too! like this!' 50 * 6);
