I HATED the lesson today sadly....
why does'nt this website encourage multiple solutions
this punishes thinking outside the box and makes you feel 
useless even when you know your solutions should have worked!!
agh!! I also just hate arguments in general. they make very LITTLE sense...but 
I might just be getting a bit impatient and rushing through some material...
I need to slow down and take it easy....
