so today I ended up switching to freecodecamp from codecademy...
I'm a little skeptical about the change but I unfortunately  do not
have the money to continue with codecademy after the 7 day trial.
Sadly I had to start over but this may not be a bad thing, this website 
started the first course with me running! Right off the bat, I'm starting with variables!
The instructions are more clear cut and best of all there's more than one way to solve challenges!
They do not discourage multiple paths and methods which i feel is already great for a first impression..
hope the rest of the challenge remains this awesome and that i stay persistent!
CamelCasing is pretty universal!! this accross all languages too! i really need to remember this
