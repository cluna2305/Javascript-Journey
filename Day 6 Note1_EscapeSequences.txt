IMPORTANT NOTE
Basic JavaScript: Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters: First is to allow you to use characters you might not otherwise be able to type out, such as a backspace. Second is to allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean. We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.
