Today i learned that we can search for established methods/syntax's though a website or even google!
such as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number
i learned there is so much that is already done for us and it is ok to use google or our resources if we are stuck or need help!
this is such a relief since most of this process does not revolve around memory and instead focuses on your ability to problem solve
and use critical thinking skills!
