JEEZE what a day, I had a hard time getting something SOOO simple right
I had to goole a solution...on the plus side
I did learn about stack overflow and it's great community!
They are a very healpful bunch and helped me get on the right track without giving anything away!
All in all I spent about 30 minutes today...will have more time tomorrow!
